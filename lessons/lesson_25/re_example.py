in his heart. And while
the late steamer
"Big Missouri" worked ....
and sweated
in the sun,
the retired artist sat on a barrel in the .... shade close by, dangled his legs,
munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents.
There was no lack of material;
boys happened along every little while;
they came to jeer, but .... remained to whitewash. ....
By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite, in good repair;
and when he played
out, Johnny Miller bought
in for a dead rat and a string to swing it withâ€”and so on, and so on,
hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
poor poverty, stricken boy in the .... morning, Tom was literally
rolling in wealth.'''
